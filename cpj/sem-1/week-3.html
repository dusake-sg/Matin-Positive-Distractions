            I don’t understand how going to hospitals will enhance my understanding of the situation or help with creating the solution when I already have readings from other researchers, online videos and images to cross-reference.

            <br><br>
            I’ll go to SGH, CGH and KKH since these 3 hospitals were my case studies for last year’s compendium—I think it’s only fair that I visit them physically, and who knows they might help me garner more insights by creating comparisons.

          <b>Visited KKH (with Aditi and Rossane)</b> <br>
Explored level 1 and basement 1. Public access is limited to 2, 1, B1 and B2. <br>
Split into half, the left side is children’s wards, and the right is women’s.<br>
Main hallways are filled with shops and F&Bs (on one side) that are bright and lively.<br>
The other side is where some wards are placed.<br>
Not sure why all waiting rooms on level 1 were empty (at the time of visit).<br>
Some had simple notes that said they’ve moved. Others didn’t and seemed to be open and functioning as per usual—except no patients and family members were inside.<br><br>
Children’s side had some differentiated design elements like splashes of bright colours and the use of a stylised (childish) font for certain signs.<br>
Some artworks were scattered around. Most walls felt empty.<br>
Lighting for shops was good. Lighting for the wards was dimly lit.<br>
Had to stop the visit short because a cleaning uncle seemed to be wary of us and began tailing.<br>
We left promptly without making a fuss about it.<br><br>

<b>Insights</b>—Images taken can be split into 3 main areas;<br>
Signs (Main visual element that aids movement)<br>
Artworks (Static visuals that aim to elevate aesthetics/moods)<br>
Spaces (Overall feel of a space based on utility, rate of utilisation and lighting)
<br><br>
<b>End note:</b> Freaking hate fieldwork within a specific building. The last time I tried to photograph/film something was IKEA and that was a hassle too. I should’ve picked something more publicly acceptable and accessible as a project 🤧.
