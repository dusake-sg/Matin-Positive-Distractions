        On a personal level, I believe major visual upgrades are required for the artefacts and the presentation as whole.
        <br><br>
        This week, I want to look at how I can recreate a more visually interesting plant interpretation, experimenting with materials and their physical limits. Additionally, explore how to implement modularity via shapes not limited to boxes. Lastly, a visual language that ties all the experiments and presentation together as a whole.</p>

      <h2 class="subPoint">Origami</h2>
      <p class="regular">Using paper seems extremely viable to carry out complex shapes but ultimately the issue of it being destroyed overtime due to humidity and more leaves more to be desired as a material. However, looking at these groups of colours and various shapes can still be used for inspiration.</p>

      <p class="regular">
        <b>Shapely Flowers</b> <br>
        While sticking to the familiar material of acrylic, could I achieve a more interesting output by simply stylising the design of a 2D flower?
      </p>

      <b>Heat Gun</b> <br>
      Layering of individual smaller cuts of acrylic creates interesting overlaps due to the colours used. Additionally, could I recreate a more 3D render of a flower using this same method? Could heat be applied to these petals so that they can be curved?</p>
    <div class="col-6" style="column-gap: 1.2em; padding: 0.5em 0em">

      <img src="images/sections/cpj/sem-2/week-13/image-21.jpg" alt="overlapping curved acrylic">
      <p class="regular">The more blobby, non-uniformed 2D petal makes for an interesting visual alongside the see-through aspect of the coloured acrylic. While unorthodox, the flower is hotglued onto the stem via a 5mm cutout in the centre which is enough to create a strong hold.</p>
      <img src="images/sections/cpj/sem-2/week-13/image-22.jpg" alt="overlapping acrylic">
      <p class="regular">Increasing in complexity, this version of stacked acrylic petals make for a more obvious translation of a real flower. This was achieved with individual egg-like shapes that has been bent with heat to achieve a curved look. Attaching each petal with hot glue is not an issue however the mess of glue residue is quite obvious as more dollops are used to connect each piece. I'm going to try acrylic-specific glue and see whether that achieves a cleaner look. Overall, I really enjoy the look of it and as an added positive, it stays in place when attached to the stem.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="regular">A potential problem in using acrylic is the weight so I was shocked to see that the flowers stayed in place when attached to the stem. However, attaching it to a base is more difficult due to the off-kilter bend of the stem which shifts the center of gravity. It requires a significantly more amount of hotglue to affix the flower + stem combo onto a flat base and I worry it'll be worse once attached to a moving cam mechanism.</p>

  <h2 class="mainPoint">Modularity</h2>
  <p class="regular">
    <b>Limitations of Wood</b> <br>
    The way the current artefacts are made are limited to squares due to the use of wood as the main material. Wood, a natural occuring material, has been said to please individuals and allow them to enter states of calmness better than unnatural alternatives like acrylic. However, the manipulation of wood to form curved walls is a much more tedious process than heating up plastics.

    <b>Finding a Modular Shape</b> <br>
    What is involved in creating modular blocks? Ideas of tesselation come to mind on how elaborate shapes can come together to form a larger patterned canvas. With the use of bent acrylic, could it be possible to make curved modules?
