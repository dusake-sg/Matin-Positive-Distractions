    <b>Water Development</b>

    <b>Include Diagrams</b>
    <br>
    Beyond sketching the forms of each development, I should also inform the readers of the flow of interaction I expect people to have when connecting with them.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, a design of the space to show some level of thought has been put into the process in figuring out real-world activation.

  <p class="regular">
    <b>Case Studies</b>
    <br>
    Move all visual inspirations into its own section before all the experimentation so they don’t feel fragmented.

  <p class="regular">
    <b>Animal Development</b>
    <br>
    The current concept and experiment feels too literal of a translation from reality. It’d be more interesting to explore aspects of what it means to be aware of the presence of birds or live animals.
<br><br>
I don’t have any immediate ideas now but aspects like bird flocks and rustling leaves from the hops of birds come to mind. Other more urbanised experiences would be pigeons who walk by the street side with their typical head swagger.
<br><br>
Aditi mentions the concept of time that can be perceived from specific bird species and their coos and chirps.
<br><br>
Adversely, a fear of birds are common amongst people and might not be as appreciated as the other aspects. She brings up a good point but maybe there’s something to learn from how people react to an abstract presence of birds.
  </p>

  <p class="regular">
    <b>Greenery Development</b>
    <br>
    I should add in the experiment with the tissue box as a material as it shows the immediacy of making an idea into reality.
<br><br>
Despite the lack of appropriate material, the resourcefulness of making use of what’s around really helps to test whether something works as well as we think it does.
<br><br>
Idk what I’m saying at this point, but at this point it makes sense to add it as a paragraph.

  When talking about the use of speakers for the animal development, the type of speaker should not be from a completed product but rather the component itself. The design of the sculpture could then possibly embrace the components as an aesthetic rather than hide everything into a boxed body.

    Realistic Matin setting the tone for the weekend here. Without a laser cutter to cut some pieces for the mobile design experiment and yet to receive my pay from last month to buy better and stronger metal wires, the next logical thing to proceed with would be the input segment of my experiments.
