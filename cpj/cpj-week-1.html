            My summer and bank account were kept busy with my internship but I
            had thoughts when revisiting my research topic. Wayfinding was an
            area of design that didn’t excite me anymore but after rereading my
            compendium, I found that there was an opportunity to do something
            within the healthcare sector still.

          <p class="regular">
            Based on some light reading, I decided to amend my angle—instead of
            tackling a brief of “creating a better wayfinding for hospitals",
            I’m deciding to
            <b
              >“create something that would ease anxiety in a sterile
              environment”.</b
            >
            Although similar in context, it provides me with more breathing room to diverge before converging. And more importantly, it doesn’t
            reduce me to just creating another branded wayfinding system (I recognise that this on its own is not an easy task).

            Thursday sharing session gave me my next steps forward; that is to
            inquire with people who’ve had
            <b>recent experiences in the hospital with regards to wayfinding</b>
            and to gather a list of
            <b>visual references to aid in my search</b> for (for a lack of a
            better term) a better thing to make.

        <h2 class="subPoint">Readings</h2>
        <p class="regular">
          I’m currently reading two books for
          <b>further research into humanising tech.</b> Hopefully, that leads me
          to write more for my dissertation and helps me move in the right
          direction.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subPoint">Enquiries</h2>
        <p class="regular">
          I have a bunch of <b>friends working in the health sector,</b> so I’m
          hoping to shed some light on what it actually feels like in hospitals.
          However, I’m not sure what exactly to ask so I’ll have to
          <b>write my enquiries down first.</b>
        </p>
        <h2 class="subPoint">Observation</h2>
        <p class="regular">
          I also am interested in how it feels like to visit a hospital for the
          first time. To experience this, I’m considering
          <b>visiting a hospital and noting down my thoughts</b> and getting in
          contact with <b>individuals who have been to hospitals.</b>
          <br /><br />
          More importantly, I would prefer to get a subject who’s early into
          their hospital experience and follow them closely to gauge how things
          change over the course of the year.

          To my surprise, my classmates were leaning towards the bottom left
          segment of tech implementations while I’m currently focusing on the
          emotional and behavioural aspects of how we navigate in tough
          situations.

          Makes sense why they’ve chosen physical implementations rather than
          focus on the underlying issue. These are what have been voted for;

          While ignoring the number of votes, I may choose to remove the focus
          on elderlies specifically for the physical limitations of hospital
          users far expand beyond grouping by age. And Apps do not excite me as
          a finalised product.

        <p class="regular">
          The only overlapping theme is evolving systems to which I have 2 queries; <br>
          &#x2022 Are there many cases that explore materiality into digital outputs? <br>
          &#x2022 What are the limitations of evolving signages? <br>
I’ll first explore this before moving on to the other queries.
