            There's not a whole lot I know about physical computation and as Andreas has iterated multiple times, the best way to learn is by doing.

          Ying Jia was curious to see what fruit stickers would be like to an AI and asked if I knew any good links. Since I was already on the site, I decided to search “digital tech wayfinding in hospital”.

          I wasn’t too impressed with what I saw because they simply seemed to imply digital displays and an over-emphasis on the colour blue. But it does inform me of the typical trends around the designs of hospital spaces, what's expected and comfortable.

          The experiments above helped me discover the Arduino system. I learned that the coding language was similar enough to Javascript that I roughly understood what parameters to play with to create the animated arrows (seen in the images above).

          I think both options would work depending on their placement (e.g. Opt B would work if it's placed on the ground to guide people’s path) <br><br>
          In a hospital setting, I would assume that there are a lot of sectors and it might be confusing to navigate through without a proper system.<br><br>
          I think it's a great exploration of methods of wayfinding that isn’t obstructed by barriers such as languages<br><br>
          Explore more about their effectiveness when they are placed in different locations (e.g. on the ground, at eye level, embedded on the floor, etc)

          Will it be switched on during the day as well? If so, will the light be different / move differently?
          Should the speed of the light follow the walking pace of the individual? <br><br>
          If it's too fast, the person might feel rushed <br><br>
          Too slow they might not notice the light following them at all. <br><br>
          What if many people walked past? How many dot lights would there be? Would it be chaotic or organised in a pattern?<br><br>
          People doing Lasik, would they be affected?

          How people can find their way without specific symbols? <br><br>
          Maybe a new form of interactive visuals might be needed?<br><br>
          Option B looks like there's more potential to be developed as another way of wayfinding

          How it brings me to the correct direction/places <br><br>
          What is the input? (Where to press to show me the direction)<br><br>
          Ideas: maybe a compass that shows the direction in the hospital.<br><br>
          What colour represents the correct direction?

          Now that I see the experiment, I realise how bright the LED signage was. However, I feel that it might be too bright for some users to get to a certain place. Taking into consideration that their end goal is just to reach their destination. <br><br>
          I feel that this wayfinding might work better in places like Gri.d or somerset.

          The comparison between the 2 different symbols used depicts different visual emotions for people like how Rachel mentions “it looks scary for the dotted light to be seen at night!” <br><br>
Would this visual representation take away the seriousness of a hospital?<br><br>
Would older people complain about eye sensitivity to light?<br><br>
Different colours for different clinics/wards; have a legend for the colours. (Follow the light)
